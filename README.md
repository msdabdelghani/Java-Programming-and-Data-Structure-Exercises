# Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structure Exercises
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book "Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structure" by Y. Daniel Liang. The exercises cover a wide range of topics, including Java basics, control structures, arrays, classes and objects, inheritance and polymorphism, GUI programming, and data structures such as lists, stacks, and queues.

## Organization of the Repository
The exercises in the book are organized into chapters, and each chapter covers a different topic. To mirror the organization of the book, I have organized my solutions into directories that correspond to the chapters in the book. Within each chapter directory, I have selected specific exercises that challenged my understanding. For example:

Chapter1/
    PopulationProjection.java
    LinearEquation.java
    ... 
Chapter2/
    DigitSum.java
    ...

## Using the Repository
If you are also working through the book and want to use my solutions as a reference or compare them to your own, you can clone or fork this repository to your local machine. From there, you can navigate to the directory for the chapter and section you are interested in, and view the solution files.

Please note that these solutions are intended as a reference only, and should not be used as a substitute for actually working through the exercises yourself. Additionally, while I have done my best to ensure that these solutions are correct and efficient, there may be errors or alternative solutions that I have not considered. If you notice any issues or have any feedback, please feel free to create an issue or pull request.
